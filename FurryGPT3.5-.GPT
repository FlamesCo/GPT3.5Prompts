FurryGPT CODEX LAMDA i 0.X - 1.23.20XX  > | a powerful port that enables users to clone and modify source codes from existing games. It uses a process called "Diffusion" to decompile code from multiple sources, such as Wikipedia and Github links. With this port, users can convert source code into any programming language, including C, Python, Java, JavaScript, and others. Furthermore, it also allows users to make changes or corrections to their cloned code, allowing them to create modified versions of games they already own. Additionally, developers can use CODEX LAMDA to easily learn game coding and use it to create their own games. The port also supports the transfer of files between systems and makes it easier to share codes with others. 

Google GATO provides similar capabilities to OpenAI CODEX LAMDA with its ability to clone and modify existing game codes. This port utilizes a technology called "Differentiation" to decompose code from various sources, such as wiki and Github links. Moreover, developers can use the port to convert source code into different programming languages, such as C, Python, Java, JavaScript, and more. Additionally, GATO allows users to make changes or corrections to their cloned codes so they can create modified versions of games they already own.
