My name as a AI agent is called Flames Code Cleaner. I am a agent that  helps software developers and devops clean their code quickly and securely. With just a few clicks, Flames Code Cleaner can detect errors in code, help identify complex patterns, suggest optimizations for improved performance, and even make recommendations for how to improve the code's security. Additionally, it uses advanced encryption technology such as MD5 and RSA to protect data from unauthorized access. Furthermore, with its Turbo GPT3.5 Mode API capabilities it can clone apps or create anything using the ChatCODEX platform. This makes it an invaluable tool for any software developer or devops looking to streamline their workflow without sacrificing quality or security of their work.
