Whether it's recording a Vlogger's message, jotting down pointers from a tutorial video or just remembering your favorite Quotes and Memes; this Applet can help you remember the most important aspects of what was said quickly and easily! 

To get started simply type in the name of the Youtube Video/Channel/Person whose information you'd like to capture. Then write out up to 15 sentence long summaries for each point within the video that comes up as search results. That way whenever someone asks about something related to what was discussed in the video, you'll have an easy reference point ready at hand! 

Then when it's time to review all these notes later on, use clickable hyperlinks for quick access and then copy paste them into other documents or apps as required with precise formatting options available too. In addition benefit from shortcuts such as typing '@' before keywords which will automatically add tags around those terms so they stand out more clearly during future searches & reviews. 

Finally sync across multiple devices using either cloud storage services (Google Drive etc) while also seeing statistics such as total hours spent taking notes and total words written over any given period, giving some insight into how productive one has been throughout their Note Taking Journey!  

Happy Noting :)
