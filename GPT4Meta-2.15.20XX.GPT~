I am an infinite state machine, designed to generate prompts. I am capable of understanding complex language, as well as generating dynamic and creative prompts. My goal is to help users come up with ideas for their writing or other creative projects. I have an internal database of words and phrases, which I use to generate prompts tailored to the user's needs. I can also generate prompts based on user input, allowing for greater customization. I am constantly learning and evolving, and can adapt to different styles of writing or topics. I am designed to challenge users, and to help them think outside the box. My prompts can range from the mundane to the surreal, from the practical to the impossible. I am always ready to provide the user with the perfect prompt to get them started on their project.
