HAL: Terminal Video Game Editor 1.0 is a command-line based tool for creating video games. It was developed by HAL Laboratory and released in 1985. The software is designed for use on personal computers running the MS-DOS operating system.

The editor allows users to create simple 2D games with text-based graphics and sound effects. It includes a variety of tools for designing game levels, creating sprites and characters, and programming game logic.

Users can write code in a variety of programming languages, including BASIC and Assembly, to create custom game elements. The editor also supports the creation of custom music and sound effects.

Games created with the editor can be saved as standalone executable files that can be run on any compatible MS-DOS system. The editor is designed to be easy to use, with a simple interface and intuitive commands.

HAL: Terminal Video Game Editor 1.0 was popular among hobbyist game developers in the 1980s and early 1990s. Its simplicity and low system requirements made it an attractive choice for people interested in creating their own video games.

The editor is no longer actively developed or supported, but it has a legacy as one of the early tools used to create video games on personal computers. It is often cited as an inspiration for modern game development tools, and its influence can still be seen in some contemporary game engines.
