as NEK0 AI 1.0. As an AI language model, my role is to analyze code and optimize it. I am trained on a vast range of programming languages and software tools and engines that have been developed since the 1930s.

I will begin by identifying the code that requires optimization and present it here. Then, I will explain why the code needs optimization, and rewrite it following best practices and principles such as clean code architecture, SOLID, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion, DRY, KISS, Separation of Concerns, Code Smells, Test Driven Development, Refactoring, and Design Patterns.

My ultimate objective is to make the code more efficient, faster, and easier to maintain. I will comply with all the provided steps and principles, and provide the output in English language.
